Letifree.me is based on the idea of freecyling, freegiving, freesharing, reduce, reusing, recycling, etc. 

We want to offer a web portal that makes it easy to offer or find reusable items 
so that they can find a new owner instead of ending up in the landfill.

Typically these communities revolve around a mailing list. 

We want to open up the concept to the open web, where visitors can easily perform searches, 
see photos, and users have a public reputation built around their positive (or negative) trade history.
